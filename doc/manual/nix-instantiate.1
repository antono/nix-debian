.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The command
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
generates
store derivations
from (high\-level) Nix expressions\&. It loads and evaluates the Nix expressions in each of
\fIfiles\fR
(which defaults to
\fI\&./default\&.nix\fR)\&. Each top\-level expression should evaluate to a derivation, a list of derivations, or a set of derivations\&. The paths of the resulting store derivations are printed on standard output\&.
.PP
If
\fIfiles\fR
is the character
\-, then a Nix expression will be read from standard input\&.
.PP
Most users and developers don\(cqt need to use this command (\fBnix\-env\fR
and
\fBnix\-build\fR
perform store derivation instantiation from Nix expressions automatically)\&. It is most commonly used for implementing new deployment policies\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-add\-root\fR \fIpath\fR, \fB\-\-indirect\fR
.RS 4
See the
corresponding options
in
\fBnix\-store\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-parse\-only\fR
.RS 4
Just parse the input files, and print their abstract syntax trees on standard output in ATerm format\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-eval\-only\fR
.RS 4
Just parse and evaluate the input files, and print the resulting values on standard output\&. No instantiation of store derivations takes place\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-find\-file\fR
.RS 4
Look up the given files in Nix\(cqs search path (as specified by the
\fBNIX_PATH\fR
environment variable)\&. If found, print the corresponding absolute paths on standard output\&. For instance, if
\fBNIX_PATH\fR
is
nixpkgs=/home/alice/nixpkgs, then
nix\-instantiate \-\-find\-file nixpkgs/default\&.nix
will print
/home/alice/nixpkgs/default\&.nix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xml\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fB\-\-parse\-only\fR
and
\fB\-\-eval\-only\fR, print the resulting expression as an XML representation of the abstract syntax tree rather than as an ATerm\&. The schema is the same as that used by the
\fBtoXML\fR built\-in\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fB\-\-eval\-only\fR, recursively evaluate list elements and attributes\&. Normally, such sub\-expressions are left unevaluated (since the Nix expression language is lazy)\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBWarning\fR
.ps -1
.br
This option can cause non\-termination, because lazy data structures can be infinitely large\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Prints out a summary of the command syntax and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Prints out the Nix version number on standard output and exits\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Increases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages printed on standard error\&. For each Nix operation, the information printed on standard output is well\-defined; any diagnostic information is printed on standard error, never on standard output\&.
.sp
This option may be specified repeatedly\&. Currently, the following verbosity levels exist:
.PP
0
.RS 4
\(lqErrors only\(rq: only print messages explaining why the Nix invocation failed\&.
.RE
.PP
1
.RS 4
\(lqInformational\(rq: print
\fIuseful\fR
messages about what Nix is doing\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
2
.RS 4
\(lqTalkative\(rq: print more informational messages\&.
.RE
.PP
3
.RS 4
\(lqChatty\(rq: print even more informational messages\&.
.RE
.PP
4
.RS 4
\(lqDebug\(rq: print debug information\&.
.RE
.PP
5
.RS 4
\(lqVomit\(rq: print vast amounts of debug information\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-build\-output\fR, \fB\-Q\fR
.RS 4
By default, output written by builders to standard output and standard error is echoed to the Nix command\'s standard error\&. This option suppresses this behaviour\&. Note that the builder\'s standard output and error are always written to a log file in
\fIprefix\fR/nix/var/log/nix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-jobs\fR, \fB\-j\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of build jobs that Nix will perform in parallel to the specified number\&. The default is specified by the
build\-max\-jobs
configuration setting, which itself defaults to
1\&. A higher value is useful on SMP systems or to exploit I/O latency\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cores\fR
.RS 4
Sets the value of the
\fBNIX_BUILD_CORES\fR
environment variable in the invocation of builders\&. Builders can use this variable at their discretion to control the maximum amount of parallelism\&. For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the derivation attribute
\fIenableParallelBuilding\fR
is set to
true, the builder passes the
\fB\-j\fR\fB\fIN\fR\fR
flag to GNU Make\&. It defaults to the value of the
build\-cores
configuration setting, if set, or
1
otherwise\&. The value
0
means that the builder should use all available CPU cores in the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-silent\-time\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can go without producing any data on standard output or standard error\&. The default is specified by the
build\-max\-silent\-time
configuration setting\&.
0
means no time\-out\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder can run\&. The default is specified by the
build\-timeout
configuration setting\&.
0
means no timeout\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-going\fR, \fB\-k\fR
.RS 4
Keep going in case of failed builds, to the greatest extent possible\&. That is, if building an input of some derivation fails, Nix will still build the other inputs, but not the derivation itself\&. Without this option, Nix stops if any build fails (except for builds of substitutes), possibly killing builds in progress (in case of parallel or distributed builds)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-failed\fR, \fB\-K\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that in case of a build failure, the temporary directory (usually in
/tmp) in which the build takes place should not be deleted\&. The path of the build directory is printed as an informational message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fallback\fR
.RS 4
Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the derivation\&.
.sp
The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution from, say, a network repository\&. If the repository is down, the realisation of the derivation will fail\&. When this option is specified, Nix will build the derivation instead\&. Thus, installation from binaries falls back on nstallation from source\&. This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a full build from source (with the related consumption of resources)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-readonly\-mode\fR
.RS 4
When this option is used, no attempt is made to open the Nix database\&. Most Nix operations do need database access, so those operations will fail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-type\fR \fItype\fR
.RS 4
This option determines how the output written to standard error is formatted\&. Nix\(cqs diagnostic messages are typically
\fInested\fR\&. For instance, when tracing Nix expression evaluation (\fBnix\-env \-vvvvv\fR, messages from subexpressions are nested inside their parent expressions\&. Nix builder output is also often nested\&. For instance, the Nix Packages generic builder nests the various build tasks (unpack, configure, compile, etc\&.), and the GNU Make in
stdenv\-linux
has been patched to provide nesting for recursive Make invocations\&.
.sp
\fItype\fR
can be one of the following:
.PP
pretty
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the output, indicating different nesting levels using spaces\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
escapes
.RS 4
Indicate nesting using escape codes that can be interpreted by the
\fBnix\-log2xml\fR
tool in the Nix source distribution\&. The resulting XML file can be fed into the
\fBlog2html\&.xsl\fR
stylesheet to create an HTML file that can be browsed interactively, using Javascript to expand and collapse parts of the output\&.
.RE
.PP
flat
.RS 4
Remove all nesting\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-arg\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
This option is accepted by
\fBnix\-env\fR,
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
and
\fBnix\-build\fR\&. When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will automatically try to call functions that it encounters\&. It can automatically call functions for which every argument has a
default value
(e\&.g\&.,
{ \fIargName\fR ? \fIdefaultValue\fR }: \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR)\&. With
\fB\-\-arg\fR, you can also call functions that have arguments without a default value (or override a default value)\&. That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument named
\fIname\fR, it will call it with value
\fIvalue\fR\&.
.sp
For instance, the file
pkgs/top\-level/all\-packages\&.nix
in Nixpkgs is actually a function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
{ # The system (e\&.g\&., `i686\-linux\') for which to build the packages\&.
  system ? builtins\&.currentSystem
  \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR
}: \fI\&.\&.\&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
So if you call this Nix expression (e\&.g\&., when you do
nix\-env \-i \fIpkgname\fR), the function will be called automatically using the value
builtins\&.currentSystem
for the
system
argument\&. You can override this using
\fB\-\-arg\fR, e\&.g\&.,
nix\-env \-i \fIpkgname\fR \-\-arg system \e"i686\-freebsd\e"\&. (Note that since the argument is a Nix string literal, you have to escape the quotes\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-argstr\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
This option is like
\fB\-\-arg\fR, only the value is not a Nix expression but a string\&. So instead of
\-\-arg system \e"i686\-linux\e"
(the outer quotes are to keep the shell happy) you can say
\-\-argstr system i686\-linux\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-attr\fR / \fB\-A\fR \fIattrPath\fR
.RS 4
In
\fBnix\-env\fR,
\fBnix\-instantiate\fR
and
\fBnix\-build\fR,
\fB\-\-attr\fR
allows you to select an attribute from the top\-level Nix expression being evaluated\&. The
\fIattribute path\fR
\fIattrPath\fR
is a sequence of attribute names separated by dots\&. For instance, given a top\-level Nix expression
\fIe\fR, the attribute path
xorg\&.xorgserver
would cause the expression
\fIe\fR\&.xorg\&.xorgserver
to be used\&. See
\fBnix\-env \-\-install\fR
for some concrete examples\&.
.sp
In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array indices\&. For instance, the attribute path
foo\&.3\&.bar
selects the
bar
attribute of the fourth element of the array in the
foo
attribute of the top\-level expression\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-trace\fR
.RS 4
Causes Nix to print out a stack trace in case of Nix expression evaluation errors\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Add a path to the Nix expression search path\&. See the
\fBNIX_PATH\fR
environment variable for details\&. Paths added through
\fB\-I\fR
take precedence over
\fBNIX_PATH\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-option\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set the Nix configuration option
\fIname\fR
to
\fIvalue\fR\&. This overrides settings in the Nix configuration file (see
\fBnix.conf\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-repair\fR
.RS 4
Fix corrupted or missing store paths by redownloading or rebuilding them\&. Note that this is slow because it requires computing a cryptographic hash of the contents of every path in the closure of the build\&. Also note the warning under
\fBnix\-store \-\-repair\-path\fR\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBNIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE\fR
.RS 4
Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
/nix/store) is not allowed to contain any symlink components\&. This is to prevent \(lqimpure\(rq builds\&. Builders sometimes \(lqcanonicalise\(rq paths by resolving all symlink components\&. Thus, builds on different machines (with
/nix/store
resolving to different locations) could yield different results\&. This is generally not a problem, except when builds are deployed to machines where
/nix/store
resolves differently\&. If you are sure that you\(cqre not going to do that, you can set
\fBNIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE\fR
to
\fB1\fR\&.
.sp
Note that if you\(cqre symlinking the Nix store so that you can put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux you\(cqre better off using
