Description: Purely functional package manager
 Nix treats packages like values in purely functional programming
 languages such as Haskell — they are built by functions that don’t
 have side-effects, and they never change after they have been
 built. This leads to following powerful features:
 .
   - Atomic upgrades and rollbacks
   - Multiple versions of the same package
   - Complete dependencies
   - Multi-user support (non root users can install packages)
   - Transparent source/binary deployment
 .
